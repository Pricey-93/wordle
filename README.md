## About The Project

I created this project in order to learn about the MVC software architectural design pattern. I also included the Observer pattern, using the view as a subscriber of the model.
The game works the same as the original except that you can play again with no daily limit.

There is a secret word and you have six guesses to get the correct answer.

* Green - The guessed letter is in the word and in the correct position.
* Yellow - The guessed letter is in the word and in the wrong position.
* Dark Grey - The guessed letter is not in the word.
* Black (keyboard view) - The letter has not been guessed yet.
